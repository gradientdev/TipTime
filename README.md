# TipTime
A simple tip app that I am developing for practice.
It is currently under review by Google, and will likely be made public in the next few days!

The app has the capability to calculate tips out of 3 options, round up values, and split bills!
I decided to make this app to better my Android development skills and for fun.

This app's theme is strawberries/milk.
